SignatureCoin (SIGN)

SignatureCoin is an innovative X11 PoW/PoS crypto coin. It has a fresh implementation of the coinjoin anonymous wallet. It also uses the advanced PoW/PoS separation technology so both PoW and PoS are more stable and secure, while ensuring a very fast transaction time, usually less than 1 min for transaction confirmation.

It has an innovative distribution model. 75% coins are distributed freely based on the "signature" field of user of Bitcointalk forum. The user will receive daily coin distribution if he keeps the signature updated with what is defined in the SignatureCoin main thread or the website. The distribution will be over a period of 90 days. 10% of the coins will be mineable, and rest 15% coins are used for mixers (coinjoin purpose).
